This algorithm is an expression of my experience with technical analysis of stock chart patterns as code to be automated and executed. The data which derives the technical indicators
are stock prices on multiple timeframes. Different portfolio optimization techniques and their combinations, alongside directionality of bets mean for a plethora of different algorithms
to execute based on investor preferences. In addition, stop losses, and take-profits are executed alongside regular buy and short orders via a direction connection to a brokerage through
their API such that all transactions are done with a couple of clicks. The weighting of the hand-crafted algorithm to be aggregated is done through the research of the backtesting tool featured in this 
repository.
