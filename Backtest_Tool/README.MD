Given timeseries of price data for any timeframe along with capital weightings of equities within a portfolio, I can simulate how much profit I would make over a period of time 
into the past. Different stop-losses(regular,trailing), direction of bets(long/short, reverse), portfolio optimization models(HRP,Black-Litterman,Black-Litterman with HRP-weighted priors),
and thresholds are all factors that can be tuned and modified to return the best all-around backtest. Measures of strategy success such as the Sharpe and Sortino Ratios, along with 
Kelly's Criterion formula, are calculated for hundreds of samples over the same time period to ensure a robust selection of a proper strategy.
